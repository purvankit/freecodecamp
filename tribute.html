            <p>“Nobody likes being alone that much. I don't go out of my way to make friends, that's all. It just leads to disappointment.”</p>
            <p>“Memories warm you up from the inside. But they also tear you apart.”</p>
            <p>“Why do people have to be this lonely? What's the point of it all? Millions of people in this world, all of them yearning, looking to others to satisfy them, yet isolating themselves. Why? Was the earth put here just to nourish human loneliness?”</p>
